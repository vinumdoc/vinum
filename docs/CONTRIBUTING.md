# Contributing to Vinum

Vinum is open source and you are welcome and encouraged to contribute.

These are a few guidelines.

## Contribution workflow

The official Vinum repository is at https://github.com/monacofj/Vinum
  
To start contributing, make sure you've read the essential documentation
thoroughly:

   - [vinum.md](/docs/vinum.md)
   - [CONTRIBUTING.md](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md])
   - [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Then, go through the following steps.

1. Either pick an issue that you want to work on, or create a new one describing
   the problem or suggestion that you want to be addressed.

3. If you want to contribute a solution for that issue:

    * fork the project
    * create a local branch for the issue.
    * edit the relevant files in the branch
    * run lint check if available (see 'Developer tools' below)
    * push your branch into your repository
    * got to github and make it into a pull/merge request

5. Go have a cup of wine, as youâ€™ve earned it.

## Project standards

To keep things consistent, when applicable, we aim at some some standards.

- REUSE specification vr. 3 [1]

- GitFlow branching strategy [2]

- Semantic versioning 2.0.0 [3]

## Code convention

Oh, that.

Code convention always tend to be a sensitive topic among programmers as it
calls forth personal convictions and the weight of beloved traditions. As often,
preferences vary largely. With that, we humbly as you to be indulgent about the
choices made in this project.

* Symbol names, comments, file names etc. always in English.

* Casing, indentation, block alignment etc.: stick to the project's conventions.

* Comments are text. Use caption and punctuation accordingly.


## Attribution and licensing

If you have substantially modified an existing source or documentation
file --- say it's considerably more than a simple typo correction or
small bug fix --- you are entitled to have your name added to the copyright
notice [1] and to the `AUTHORS` file, should you desire.

By submitting your contribution you agree that it will be available under the
same license as SYSeg (GNU GPL vr. 3 or later).

## Commit Messages

When applicable, use the following convention for commit messages:

When editing the commit message, use the following keywords, inspired on a 
lax version of  Conventional Commits [4], to describe the purpose of your
contribution:

- `dev`      :   advance code (add of modify a feature)
- `fix`      :   fix a bug or an unmeat requirement.
- `ref`      :   refactor code for quality or compliance
- `doc`      :   modify or extend documentation
- `build`    :   improve the build process
- `repo`     :   tide up the repository and organization
- `minor`    :   something too simple as typo or cosmetics
- `other`    :   something else

The suggested commit messages is

`<purpose> : short description`

where 'purpose' is one of the contribution purposes listed above.

The short description should be in imperative form (fix, add, remove etc.)
rather than past (fixed, added) or present (fixes, adds) --- as if ordering
what the change should do (mind the capitalization). Do not punctuate.

Example:

```
fix: correct wrong file name

fix: add missing semicolon

doc: update user manual

repo: removed object files
```

Ideally, each commit should be of only one type. In practice, though,
it's reasonable to group changes in a single commit if they are naturally
related (e.g. you modifying a function's argument type and edit the developer
documentation to reflect the change). In those cases, it's ok to use

```
<purpose 1> : short description 1

<purpose 2> : short description 2
...
```

Purpose indication in commit messages is suggested, but not mandatory (if not
used, capitalize the first letter. Leave a blank line between statements.

If it helps to understand the context, do not refrain from adding a paragraph
further explaining the commit. This is normal text, so, capitalize and
punctuate accordingly.


## PR/MR merging

In the regular workflow, contributions in the form PR/MRs should be submitted
to the mainstream repository, then analyzed and merged into the destination
branch. Bypassing the regular protocols is exceptionally acceptable, at the
discretion of the project maintainers, to address urgent demands such as
critical repository maintenance or emergency bug fixes.


## Other conventions

Compliance to Keep a ChangeLog [5] is under consideration.
